# ====== Temporary  files
# Files with names that start with a percent sign (`%`) are considered temporary and should not be committed.
# This keeps the file extension intact so editors can still provide syntax highlighting and other language features.
# The `~` character is easily confused with `$HOME` (with potentially dreadful consequences), `.` is used for hidden
# files, `$` and `#` trigger shell voodoo, and `_` is used by some language conventions (e.g. Python). ChatGPT said:
# > The `%` is basically the Switzerland of prefix characters: neutral, overlooked, but reliably there when you need it.

# ====== Generated HTML files
# It's a bit hard to determine which `.html` files have been generated and which ones are hand-crafted
# because `.html` is a valid source file extension and is used everywhere in this repo.
# So the exclusion list is limited to `.html` files that are assumed to have been generated from some known files like
# `README.md` and `LICENSE.md`, and `.html` files that reside inside a `docs` or `scribbles` subdirectory. The `.html`
# files in those directories are assumed to have been generated from the markdown files inside those subdirectories.

# The `out` directory is created by the "Markdown All in One" VSCode extension
# when its "Print documents to HTML (select a source folder)" menu option is used.
